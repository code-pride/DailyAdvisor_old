## Using Prettier

If you are using Visual Studio Code, install **Prettier** extension, than add this line to your settings, to formatOnSave with prettier

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

Write without hesitation, and thinking about code indentation or so, **Prettier** will handle it for you. Yeah!
